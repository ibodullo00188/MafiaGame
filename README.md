# Mafia Telegram Mini App

A group social-deduction game: the bot lives in a Telegram group, one
`/start` posts a join button, everyone taps it, and the game itself runs
as a Telegram Mini App (WebSocket-driven, server-authoritative) styled as
a cinematic film-noir poster.

Three pieces, three processes:

```
mafia-game/
├── backend/     FastAPI game engine + REST/WebSocket API + the Mini App itself
│   └── app/static/   index.html + app.js — served by the backend, no separate host needed
├── bot/         aiogram 3 bot — posts the join button, nothing else
```

## How the pieces fit together

1. **Bot** (`bot/bot.py`): admin adds the bot to a group. Anyone runs
   `/start` in that group. The bot posts one button — a Telegram `web_app`
   button whose URL is the backend's address plus `?chat_id=<the group>`.
2. **Mini App** (`backend/app/static/`): tapping the button opens this.
   It reads Telegram's signed `initData` for identity and the `chat_id`
   from its own URL, logs in, and calls `POST /games/for-chat`.
3. **Backend** (`backend/app/`): `for-chat` is the *only* way a match gets
   created — the first tap creates it and that player becomes host; every
   tap after joins the same match. No one ever calls a generic "create
   game" endpoint. From there the WebSocket (`/ws/games/{id}`) carries
   every state update: lobby → role reveal → night → day → vote → result
   → next night, or game over. The host can start once 6+ have joined;
   at 25 it starts itself.

There is no database the frontend talks to directly and no separate
static-file host to configure — `GET /` on the backend serves the app,
`/static/app.js` serves its script, and everything else is the API.

## Running it locally

```bash
# 1) backend
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # fill in TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, SESSION_SECRET
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# 2) bot (separate terminal)
cd bot
pip install -r requirements.txt
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...        # same token as the backend
export WEBAPP_URL=https://<a public HTTPS URL for the backend>
python bot.py
```

Telegram requires the Mini App URL to be **public HTTPS** — `localhost`
will not work from a real Telegram client. For local development, tunnel
port 8000 (ngrok, Cloudflare Tunnel, etc.) and put that URL in
`WEBAPP_URL`. In production, both processes point at wherever the backend
is actually deployed (Fly.io, a VPS, ...).

## Deploying free: Render + Neon

`render.yaml` at the repo root is a Render Blueprint for exactly one free
resource: a `plan: free` web service. Two things make that possible for
the *whole* stack, not just the backend:

- **No Render Postgres.** Render's free Postgres instances expire after
  30 days; there's deliberately no `databases:` block in `render.yaml`.
  Instead, `DATABASE_URL` points at an external
  [Neon](https://neon.tech) Postgres project — free tier, doesn't expire.
  Paste in Neon's connection string exactly as their dashboard gives it
  (`sslmode=require&channel_binding=require` included); `asyncpg` doesn't
  understand those libpq-style params and would crash on them as-is, so
  `backend/app/database.py` strips and translates them itself. Use
  Neon's **direct** connection string (no `-pooler` in the hostname) —
  simpler than dealing with PgBouncer's prepared-statement caveats for an
  always-on service like this one (the backend sets
  `statement_cache_size=0` defensively either way, so the pooled one
  would also work if that's what you'd rather use).
- **No separate worker for the bot.** Render's free tier has no free
  instance type for background workers — only web services, static
  sites, Postgres, and Key Value. `bot/bot.py`'s long-polling process
  needs a worker, so instead `backend/app/telegram_bot.py` runs the same
  two handlers over a **webhook** — a route on the *same* free web
  service, registered automatically with Telegram on startup. Set
  `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_ENABLED=true` (already set in `render.yaml`) for this
  mode; leave it `false` (the default) anywhere still running
  `bot/bot.py` as its own process (a VPS, Fly.io) — a bot token can only
  be in webhook or polling mode at a time, so pick one deployment target.

Setup: create a Neon project and copy its connection string, get a bot
token from @BotFather, find your own Telegram ID via @userinfobot for
`ADMIN_TELEGRAM_IDS`, then in the Render dashboard: **New → Blueprint →**
pick this repo **→ Apply**. Render prompts for the `sync: false`
variables (`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `DATABASE_URL`, `ADMIN_TELEGRAM_IDS`)
during that flow; `SESSION_SECRET` and `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` are
auto-generated. Full detail is commented in `render.yaml` itself.

The one real tradeoff: a free web service spins down after 15 minutes of
no traffic and takes a few seconds to wake back up on the next request or
Telegram update. Fine for a friend-group game; upgrade the instance type
later if that cold start ever matters.

## Tests

```bash
cd backend && pytest -q
```

322 tests: the full game engine (roles, night resolution, voting, win
conditions for all three factions), Telegram `initData` verification,
Telegram group-membership enforcement on `for-chat`, the automatic
night/day/vote/results phase cycle, the bot-owner global admin panel
(both the `GameEngine` `host_id=None` "system caller" path and the REST
layer's `require_bot_admin` gate), the Neon/asyncpg connection-string
handling and the webhook-mode bot integration (including that importing
it never constructs a real, token-validated `Bot`), the `GameHistory`/
profile endpoints (`/me/profile`, `/me/games`), the group announcement
and finished-game-pruning logic, and full-stack smoke tests that
exercise the real HTTP + WebSocket path end-to-end (join over REST →
connect the socket → start the game → confirm a role was dealt) —
this last kind of test is what caught a real crash (`get_player_view`
throwing on the very first WebSocket message, before any role was
assigned) that the earlier engine-only tests couldn't see.

## What's genuinely done vs. what's still a v1 simplification

**Solid:**
- All 20 roles, all 20 player-count compositions (6–25), night resolution,
  voting, win conditions — unchanged from Phase 1, still 100% test-covered.
- The group-bound match model described above (`for-chat`, auto-start at
  25) — this didn't exist until this pass; earlier builds only had a
  generic "create game" flow that didn't match the product.
- The Mini App is now wired to real data end to end: lobby roster, role
  reveal, night action prompts (built generically from
  `night_action_type`/`night_action_needs_target` so the frontend never
  hardcodes per-role logic), voting, outcome, and win screens all reflect
  actual server state, not placeholders.
- **Personal profile dashboard** (`GET /me/profile`, `GET /me/games`,
  `app/api/routes_me.py`): every player gets their own screen in the Mini
  App — avatar/name, lifetime games/wins/losses/winrate, per-faction win
  counts, their currently-active game if any, and their 5 most recent
  finished games. Reachable from the lobby's profile button, the win
  screen's "Bosh menu" button, or a new "👤 Profilim" bot menu entry that
  opens the Mini App straight onto the profile tab.
- **User dashboard + leaderboard**: a logged-in player with no group lands
  on a Home screen with buttons for their Profile, a public trainable
  **Leaderboard** (`GET /leaderboard` — top players by wins, active
  players only), About, and a Language switcher that writes the same
  per-user language row the bot's `/til` uses (`POST /auth/language`).
- **Permission-based premium Admin panel in the Mini App**
  (`app/services/admin_service.py`, `app/api/routes_admin_platform.py`):
  panel admins are promoted per-user via `AdminUser`/`AdminPermission`
  rows and granted any subset of a 13-permission × 7-module catalog
  (`users`, `admins`, `texts`, `broadcasts`, `groups`, `statistics`,
  `settings`); every `/admin/*` route re-validates the permission on each
  request, and the bot owner (`ADMIN_TELEGRAM_IDS`) is a super admin who
  can do everything. The panel UI lives inside the Mini App itself:
  user search/block/promote with per-user game history, admin
  add/remove with per-module permission toggles, live editing of the
  bot's messages and menu buttons, one-shot broadcasts to users/groups
  (compose → preview → send), group enable/disable, 7-day statistics, and
  a button reorderer. The legacy super-admin game controls ("O'yin
  nazorati") share the same shell.
- **One active game per group**: `for-chat` now returns the existing
  match if the group already has one live (a fresh match only starts once
  the previous one is finished), so two overlapping games can't silently
  split the same group's players.
- **Group announcements**: the bot posts a single public message to the
  group when a match starts and when it ends (with the winning faction
  and winner names) — language-neutral, no hidden-role leaks, best-effort
  so a failed Telegram send never blocks the game.
- **Finished-game pruning**: an ended match is dropped from the live
  registry after a grace period (`prune_finished_games`) so its group is
  freed for a replay, while the finished result stays persisted.
- **In-app discussion chat** (spec sections 11/32): real-time, scoped to
  one game, server-authoritative — alive-only, phase-gated to discussion,
  blocked for a Silencer's target that day, dead players spectate but
  can't send. The Telegram group is never involved.
- **Final role reveal + personal statistics** at game over (spec section
  22): every player's role becomes visible to everyone once the game
  ends, and each player sees their own kills/investigations/protections/
  votes-cast tally.

**Fixed since the last pass:**
- `chat_id` is now checked against Telegram's own `getChatMember` (see
  `app/services/telegram_bot_api.py`) before `for-chat` creates or joins a
  match — a caller Telegram doesn't confirm as a current member of that
  group is rejected with 403. Fails closed on any error talking to
  Telegram, including a bad/missing bot token.
- The night → day → discussion → voting → results → next night loop now
  fully drives itself off each phase's own server timer
  (`advance_to_voting_if_ready` / `start_next_night_if_ready`, called by
  the same background ticker that already force-resolved night and
  voting) — a WebApp where nobody taps anything no longer gets stuck once
  the day or the post-vote pause runs out.
- Mayor-reveal and Gunner-shoot now have their own buttons on the day
  screen (ammo/charge indicator included for the Gunner), driven off the
  same `day_action_type` field the backend was already sending. Both are
  now also enforced server-side as day-only actions (a raw message can no
  longer trigger them at night or during voting).
- Reopening the Mini App (Telegram closed and relaunched, a refresh, a
  dropped connection) now rejoins automatically instead of requiring a
  fresh tap of "Kirish", as long as the group's `chat_id` is still in the
  URL.
- A **global admin panel for the bot owner** (a new "Admin" tab, visible
  only to Telegram user IDs listed in `ADMIN_TELEGRAM_IDS` — see
  `.env.example` — not tied to being any single match's host, and usable
  without ever having joined the game being managed): browse every
  currently active match across every Telegram group, see real
  roles/alive-status for every player (the one place in the app allowed to
  show that), tune `GameSettings` before a match starts, force the current
  phase to resolve early, add +30s to the running phase, remove a player,
  or terminate a stuck match outright. All served over REST
  (`app/api/routes_admin.py`), gated by `require_bot_admin`, and backed by
  the same `GameEngine` methods a per-match host's own WebSocket messages
  already used — those now accept `host_id=None` to mean "an
  already-authorized system caller, not necessarily a player in this
  game" (see `_require_host_or_system`).
- **Free deployment on Render + Neon** (see "Deploying free" above):
  `render.yaml` for a single free web service, no Render Postgres (data
  goes to Neon instead — its free tier doesn't expire like Render's does),
  and the bot's own logic running as a webhook inside that same service
  (`app/telegram_bot.py`) since Render's free tier has no free
  background-worker instance. `bot/bot.py`'s polling-mode process is
  untouched and still the right choice for a VPS or Fly.io deployment.

**Known v1 simplifications, not bugs:**
- Host = whoever's `for-chat` call created the match, not "a Telegram
  group admin" specifically. This matches how the spec actually reads
  ("the admin *or* whoever started it"), but if you want it restricted to
  real Telegram admins, that's a further `getChatMember` role check away.
- Neutral-faction wins (Survivor/Jester/Serial Killer/Arsonist) reuse the
  Mafia win screen's artwork recolored, since only Town/Mafia have unique
  poster art from the design pass.
- The server's phase list (`lobby`, `role_assignment`, `night`,
  `day_discussion`, `voting`, `vote_results`, `game_over`) is a
  deliberately collapsed version of a more granular spec (which also
  names `night_resolution`, `morning_result`, `vote_resolution`,
  `elimination` as their own states): those steps still happen, just as
  instantaneous server-side transitions rather than states a client can
  be paused in or reconnect into mid-step. The one place this could
  matter — a player reconnecting *exactly* between night-end and the
  death announcement — falls back to just showing the day screen with no
  announcement, rather than losing or corrupting anything.
- In-memory game registry for the *live* match list, but matches now
  survive a backend restart: `app/services/checkpoint_service.py` upserts
  a `game_checkpoints` row after every meaningful event and
  `app/main.py`'s lifespan rebuilds every in-progress match from its
  checkpoint on boot (with a group announcement after recovery so players
  see the game came back). Finished games are dropped from the registry
  after a grace period and persistence continues to be the durable record
  (`Game`/`GamePlayer`/`GameHistory` rows in Postgres).
