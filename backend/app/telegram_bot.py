"""
Telegram bot logic, wired for WEBHOOK delivery instead of long-polling —
this is what lets the bot run inside the same process as the backend, with
no separate worker service. Used only when settings.telegram_webhook_enabled
is true (see app/config.py); for a VPS or Fly.io deployment that runs the
bot as its own long-polling process instead, bot/bot.py is unchanged and
still works exactly as before — a bot token can only be in one mode
(webhook or polling) at a time, so pick one deployment target per token,
not both at once.

bot/bot.py deliberately stays a minimal, standalone script (its own
requirements.txt, no database) so it can run on a bare VPS. Everything
below it (persistent menu, group picker, admin panel, support relay) needs
the backend's own DB and settings, so it only lives here — the two
commands they share (/start in a group vs. private chat) behave the same
in spirit, but bot/bot.py's private /start stays the short, DB-free
version.

# thinner logic (no admin-permission checks, no targeting on broadcasts,
