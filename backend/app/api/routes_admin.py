"""
The bot admins' global live-ops panel — deliberately separate from any
single match's host_id. Every route here is gated by require_bot_admin
(any bot admin: super admin from settings.admin_telegram_ids, or an
AdminUser panel admin), not by being "in" a particular game at all, so an
admin can see and manage every currently-running match across every
Telegram group, plus aggregate stats, without ever having joined any of
them as a player.

The state-mutating endpoints are thin wrappers around the same GameEngine
methods the per-match host's WebSocket messages already call
(app/websocket/handlers.py) — they pass host_id=None, which
_require_host_or_system treats as "already authorized upstream".
