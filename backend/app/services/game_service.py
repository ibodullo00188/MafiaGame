"""
Holds all currently-running games in memory (fast, simple, correct as long
as the server process doesn't restart mid-game — see README for the
persistence roadmap) and persists a summary to the database when a game
finishes, for history/statistics screens.

This is the seam the WebSocket layer and REST routes both call through —
neither ever touches a GameEngine's internal GameState directly.

      2. A `Game.game_id` existence check — covers the process having more

         WebSocket handler and phase_ticker both observing GAME_OVER on
         the same tick), and doubles as a safety net in general rather
         than trusting the in-memory flag alone.
    Neither replaces the other: (1) is what makes the common case cheap,
    (2) is what makes the guarantee actually hold.
