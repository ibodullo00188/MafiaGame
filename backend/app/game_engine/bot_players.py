"""
Drives the AI players the bot owner can seat from the admin panel, so a
match can be played through end to end without gathering five other people.

Design notes worth keeping in mind before changing anything here:

* This module never reaches into GameState to set outcomes. It calls the
  exact same public engine methods a real client's WebSocket message would
  (submit_night_action, submit_vote), so bots are bound by every rule real
  players are — target validity, self-target restrictions, silencing,
  charge caps. If a rule changes in the engine, bots inherit it for free
  and there is no second copy of the rules to keep in sync.

* Bots act on a delay rather than instantly. An entire night resolving the
  microsecond it begins would leave the admin staring at a screen that
  flickers between phases with nothing readable on it; the stagger also
  makes the "waiting for players" states actually observable, which is the
  main reason to run a bot game at all.

* The play is deliberately simple, not clever. It exists to exercise the
  state machine, not to be a challenging opponent: mafia avoid killing
  their own, town roles pick someone other than themselves, and everyone
  votes for a random living player. Anything smarter would make failures
  harder to interpret, since you could no longer tell an engine bug from a
  strategy quirk.
